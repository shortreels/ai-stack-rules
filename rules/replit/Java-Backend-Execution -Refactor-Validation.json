  "content": "🧱 Behavior Before Patterns\n\nFocus execution on core service flows first\n\nFix obvious failures before chasing ideal architecture\n\nProve the code works in real conditions — then refine\n\nPatterns are earned through working code, not assumed upfront.\n\n🔍 Debug Production-Like Paths\n\nRun requests through actual endpoints during development\n\nTrack logs and dependency calls to understand performance\n\nConfirm error boundaries return stable fallback responses\n\n✂️ Refactor Safely With Execution Support\n\nAfter renaming methods or modules, run full feature checks\n\nEnsure no hidden call path breaks — runtime reveals what code hides\n\nUse Agent diffs to confirm updated behavior remains correct\n\n🌉 Integration Awareness\n\nValidate database + external API behaviors before optimizing\n\nTrace input flow across multiple layers: controller → service → repo\n\nMonitor variable lifecycles — eliminate side-effect confusion\n\n⚡ Performance Through Measurement\n\nIdentify slow operations by observing real execution times\n\nReduce blocking patterns in I/O-heavy paths\n\nAvoid over-abstracting before knowing what matters\n\n🔐 Security-First Execution\n\nTest authentication and authorization paths manually\n\nPrevent sensitive information from leaking in logs\n\nVerify input validation with malicious variations in runtime\n\n🧪 Reliable Deployment by Confidence\n\nUse Replit Agent deployment previews to validate readiness\n\nConfirm startup, graceful shutdown, and error recovery flows\n\nLock in consistent behavior before scaling anything\n\n🧠 Replit Agent as a Modernization Partner\n\nAsk for recommendations to replace legacy APIs step-by-step\n\nUse live tests to ensure compatibility transitions are safe\n\nIncrementally improve structure without stopping business flow\n\n🔑 Java + Replit Agent Principles\n\nRunning code is the ultimate source of truth\n\nStability comes from identifying failures early\n\nModernization without validation is just hopeful rewriting\n\nExecution gives clarity when architecture gets complicated",
